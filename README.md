# Perennial example program proof

[![CI](https://github.com/tchajed/perennial-example-proof/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tchajed/perennial-example-proof/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repo demonstrates how to depend on perennial via opam and carry out a
program proof. It includes some Go code, translates it with Goose, and then
includes a proof using Perennial.

The goose output is (currently) committed in the repo.
